<h1>The Best Movies According to CJ</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tank Girl</h3>
<p>A strong female character that doesnt have to be dark and cryptic to be a bad ass.</p>
<h3>Pans Labrinth</h3>
<p>Giermo Deltoro has a artistic vision that is unmatched in my eyes. He has a way with whimsicle creatures that is riddled with philosophy that goes beyond what you can see. Special mention to "The Shape of Water" and "Pinocchio"</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Will always be a classic. But the 3rd is always the worst.</p>
<h3>The Arrivals</h3>
<p>A profound way of depicting the power of language.A weapon and a gift.</p>
